# NEAT-Neural-Nets

The purpose of this repository is to show all my work regarding NEAT (Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies) neural
networks, instead of the classic deep learning approach with neural networks. I will both be learning with test datasets,
and hopefully show results with the traditional approaches I've learned. 

Each project will be in its own folder with the code to follow.
